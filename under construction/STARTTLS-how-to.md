# STARTTLS how-to
This how-to is created by the Dutch Internet Standards Platform (the organization behind [internet.nl](https://internet.nl)) and is meant to provide practical information and guidance on implementing STARTTLS.

# What is STARTTLS?


# Why use STARTTLS?


# Tips, tricks and notices for implementation
* The sender address shown to the user ("RFC5322.From") is not used when authenticating. SPF uses the invisible "RFC5321.MailFrom" header. Combining SPF with DMARC removes this disadvantage. 
* E-mail forwarding is not supported, since the e-mail is often forwarded by another e-mail server.
* SPF does not work between domains that use the same e-mail server.
* Parked domains should be explicitly configured to not use e-mail. For SPF this is done with an empty policy (not mentioning any ip-adresses or hostnames which are allowed to send mail) and a hard fail: "v=spf1 â€“all".
* When processing incoming mail we advise to favor a DMARC policy over an SPF policy. Do not configure SPF rejection to go into effect early in handling, but take full advantage of the enhancements DMARC is offering. A message might still pass based on DKIM.
  * At the same time, be aware that some operaters still allow a hard fail (-all) to go into effect early in handling and skip DMARC operations. 



## Implementing STARTTLS in Postfix
**Specifics for this setup**
* Linux Debian 10 (Buster) 
* Postfix 3.4.5
* OpenSSL 1.1.1d

**Assumptions**
* Mail server is using DANE
* Software packages are already installed

### Configuring Postfix
